         <h3>Ministry Training with Grace Notes</h3>

         <div class="center">
            <b>&quot; Grace notes helped me not to focus on my strength like fasting and prayer for security and deliverance 
            but I was refocused on Jesus, it became easy to live a christian life even after a such a hostile back ground. 
            <br>My leadership team was afraid to serve God, prior to that the were busy breaking deviles. Which kept in for years 
            in every service. I started teaching our congregation systematically thru Grace Notes.  &quot;</b> Martin Wandira,

         <b>&quot; Grace Notes has done a great work in Zimbabwe and Africa at large. It has empowered ministers and churches. 
         This program has made me full of the Word and be able to teach what they know. Also GN has provided Bibles to 
         many of which some are poor that they could not afford it. We are happy that we met GN

         <p class="cambria">Many pastors and teachers use Grace Notes courses
         both for help in preparation for teaching and for use in classes held
         in Sunday schools, home schools, cell churches, and other venues where
         the Word of God is taught.</p>

         <p class="cambria">An example of this application is seen in the Grace
         Notes-sponsored ministry of the Kabwe Central Baptist Church in
         Zambia. Pastor Gabriel Nsofwa uses Grace Notes in his teaching
         ministry of the church, and he conducts Bible College classes for
         local pastors, church leaders, and student teachers, using Grace Notes
         for the core curriculum. Click on the link to the Kabwe church&#39;s

         <p class="cambria">Grace Notes offers twelve (12) Units of course
         work, each unit roughly analogous to a semester of Bible College
         instruction. Students can earn certificates for each course completed,
         Unit certificates, and Diplomas for completing various portions of the
         curriculum. See the course descriptions here: <a href=
         "DiplomaCourses.shtml">Diplomas in Bible Teaching</a></p>
