            <b>&quot;The Christian who does not understand what God has done in

         <p class="cambria">Many pastors and teachers use Grace Notes courses
         both for help in preparation for teaching and for use in classes held
         in Sunday schools, home schools, cell churches, and other venues where
         the Word of God is taught.</p>

         <p class="cambria">An example of this application is seen in the Grace
         Notes-sponsored ministry of the Kabwe Central Baptist Church in
         Zambia. Pastor Gabriel Nsofwa uses Grace Notes in his teaching
         ministry of the church, and he conducts Bible College classes for
         local pastors, church leaders, and student teachers, using Grace Notes
         for the core curriculum. Click on the link to the Kabwe church&#39;s
         web site: <a href=
         "/ZAMBIA/BibleCollege.shtml" target=
         "_blank">Grace Bible College of Kabwe (Zambia)</a></p>

         <p class="cambria">Grace Notes offers twelve (12) Units of course
         work, each unit roughly analogous to a semester of Bible College
         instruction. Students can earn certificates for each course completed,
         Unit certificates, and Diplomas for completing various portions of the
         curriculum. See the course descriptions here: <a href=
         "DiplomaCourses.shtml">Diplomas in Bible Teaching</a></p>
